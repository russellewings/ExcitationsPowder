Selection of powder data analysis routines, provided without warranty

Description of routines:

mnf2_example_plotting - demonstrates use of Horace and associated tools for plotting powder data, and taking cuts

mnf2_example_simulating_spinw - demonstrates use of Horace and SpinW when combined for simulating the powder cross-section due to spin waves

mnf2_example_fitting_spinw - as above, with a description of different fitting strategies for use of SpinW with powder data

mnf2_example_symmetry_analysis - an introduction to using SpinW's in-built symmetry analysis routines, e.g. to determine which bonds can support a DM interaction.
